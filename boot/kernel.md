**Kernel**

The kernel begins initializing the drivers and schemes that are embedded in it.
This process will print out kernel information, identifying the discovered
devices. This information can be viewed again using the `dmesg` command.

After initializing the in-kernel structures, drivers, and schemes, the first
userspace process spawned by the kernel is the `init` process.
